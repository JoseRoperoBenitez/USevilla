# University of Seville – Math Degree Projects

This repository contains a collection of academic projects developed during my Mathematics degree at the University of Seville. The work spans applied mathematics, statistical modeling, and numerical computation,
developed using R and MATLAB across key subjects:

**Linear Models and Experimental Design (MLDE)**  
Statistical analysis, ANOVA, and experimental design using R — focused on interpreting and modeling real-world data.

**Mathematical Modeling (MOM)**  
Translation of real-life scenarios into mathematical language, applying differential equations and optimization techniques. Implemented using MATLAB.

**Numerical Calculus I & II**  
Development and implementation of numerical methods such as interpolation, integration, root-finding, and differential equations using MATLAB.

These projects showcase my ability to bridge theory and practice through code, using R and MATLAB to solve complex problems with accuracy, clarity, and a strong analytical foundation.
